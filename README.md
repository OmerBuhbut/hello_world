me tessing things 

Hello ! 
my name is Omer. 
i study software engineering in Ben Gurion university in Israel.
I recently started taking interest in python after finishing learing the basics 
of the language in the "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" 
after some research i took the decision to open a Github profile so im here to 
advance my knowledge doing interesting things. 
thanks for all.
